            <p>About Me &hearts;</p>

            <p>My Background:

            I worked in non-profit for 22 years in a variety of roles from Administrative Assistant to Director of Training and Programs. I successfully secured and managed more than two million dollars in grant funded programs in New York and Florida. I have been a professional grant proposal reviewer for five years skillfully analyzing multi-million dollar proposals for the state and federal Department of Education.

            In 1999, I started a non-profit in Florida, as part of my community initiative, I provided pro bono consulting services to new  start up groups, helping these groups identify the organizational structures needed to start, build and sustain their new organization.

            As an academic professional, I taught English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) for more than 20 years in community colleges and community based organizations in New York and Florida.

            My area of expertise is in facilitating  learning through project-based learning activities that target an adult learner's strengths and learning style preferences. My approach to teaching and learning changes the way adult learners apply the knowledge, skills, and abilities they bring to the classroom by utilizing their strengths to make the learning more meaningful, memorable and useful. Be sure to view the video slideshow of one of my previous training workshops for adult education practitioners learning how to create their own project based learning activities at the 2012 Adult Education Teacher's Academy and Fall Conference.

            I hold a doctorate in Adult Education and a Master's in Education- teaching English to speakers of other languages (TESOL).

            In 2011, I relocated to Oregon, where I have been actively involved with a variety of community organizations. I launched CREATE Opportunities, LLC in 2012.<p>

          <p>My current activities include presenting educational seminars to teachers and administrators in K-12 public school districts.  Soon I will begin facilitating girls' groups for a non-profit organization that provides gender specific programs to help girls form healthy peer networks, achieve academically and begin their futures with Girls Group meetings and other enrichment activities.</p>
