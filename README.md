Oct 4, 2016- big problem, lost the entire portfolio file from my desktop IDK????.  Had to download zip file from GH to restore the portfolio, all files are back but now the .html files are not connected to display in the browser as a home page with clickable nav bar for Home and About this site. Each html file is displaying separately.  IDK????

Oct. 9, 2016- made class 12 updates: Home, Cruz Bio, & Repos all working correctly. Siteinfo.html not going to the correct location - ignore it. GH token pulls my repos and my collaborations on other projects. Would like to delete forked projects in GH, but need private account privileges - ignore it.
